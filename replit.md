## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library (New York style) built on Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and micro-interactions
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Theming**: next-themes for dark/light mode support

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API structure with `/api` prefix
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR integration for seamless development experience

### Data Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` contains database table definitions
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations (`drizzle-kit push`)
- **Current Storage**: In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage` class) as fallback when database isn't provisioned

### Build System
- **Frontend Build**: Vite bundles React application to `dist/public`
- **Backend Build**: esbuild compiles server code to `dist/index.cjs`
- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts the Express server with Vite middleware for HMR
